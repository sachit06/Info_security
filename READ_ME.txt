The following are the files present in the folder.
1. Info.py - 

-> This file contains the main project code.This code takes an input
of 54 excel files which should be present on your local computer.
I have used the same file names so it should not be a probelm.
Before you run the code please provide the location of the input files without
including the file names in line numbers 77 and 218 of the code.
Also make sure all the files are present in the same location so that the changes
made on line 77 and 218 are same. I have created a list which contains all 
the file names. These file names will be directly used to call the file from
its location. Once the changes are made please run the file and make sure 
all the libraries used in the file are installed in your python. 

-> After the code finishes runnig three excel output files are generated
one for each window i.e 10sec, 227sec and 5mins.
The following are the excel file names.
1.10sec_window.xlsx
2.227sec_window.xlsx
3.300sec_window.xlsx

-> I have pasted the copies of these output files in the folder for your
reference.

2. 10sec_window.xlsx - Output for 10secs window.

3. 227sec_window.xlsx - Output for 227secs window.

4. 300sec_window.xlsx - Output for 300secs window.

5. Y_or_N.py - 

-> This code is used to create the 'Yes' or 'No' tables for the above excel files.
-> Just like Info.py you need to provide the location of the output files without
mentioning the file names. The file names are already included in the list.
-> It generates three excel files are output.

6. 10sec_Y_or_N - Yes/No file for 10secs window.

7. 227sec_Y_or_N - Yes/No file for 227secs window.

8. 300sec_Y_or_N - Yes/No file for 300secs window.
